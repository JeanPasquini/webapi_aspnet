# Web_API_ASP.NET 📡

The **Web API ASP.NET** is a project that showcases my skills in developing RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Web API. The API is designed to manage secure and efficient data interactions, enabling integration with a web application for dynamic data manipulation and display.

## Features ✨

- **RESTful API**: The API follows the RESTful architecture for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Authentication and Authorization 🔐**: Permission management based on specific roles, ensuring secure data access.
- **Swagger 📜**: API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger, allowing developers to test the endpoints directly through the Swagger UI.
- **Database Integration 💾**: The API interacts with a SQL Server database, ensuring data persistence and ease of querying.
- **Endpoint Creation ⚙️**: Endpoints are created to handle data management, supporting CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Release - v1.0.9049.13975 🔷

- Implementation of data storage using a local database (no further updates planned for this).
- Security management for specific functionality buttons.
- Creation of user accounts with unique properties.
- Integration with a RESTful API built using ASP.NET Web API for database communication ([API Repository](https://github.com/JeanPasquini/webapi_aspnet)).
- Frontend developed with Bootstrap and FontAwesome icons for a modern and responsive user interface.

## Requirements ⚙️

- **Database**: SQL Server
- **.NET 7.0 or higher** 🌐
- **Swagger**: For interactive API documentation 📜

## How It Works 🔍

This API is built to serve as the backend for the [Web_Connection_NET](https://github.com/JeanPasquini/webapp_aspnet) project, which is a modern and responsive web application. The API manages the data requests made by the user interface, providing efficient communication with the database and implementing security logic for each operation.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Clone the API repository: [Web_API_ASPNET](https://github.com/JeanPasquini/webapi_aspnet)
2. Set up the database and connection string as outlined in the repository.
3. Run the API project to start the backend server.
4. Access the API documentation via Swagger UI: `http://localhost:<port>/swagger`
5. Use the web application to interact with the data and access the API endpoints.
